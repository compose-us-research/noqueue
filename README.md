# What it does # 

## The problem ##
When the shops, restaurants and studios reopen, they have to somehow manage their visitors, guests and patients so that the distances etc. can be kept. Customers also have an interest in not being in full shops, practices, etc. This will remain the case until at least spring 2021.


## The solution ##
With "Platzhalter.io", businesses and non-profits can easily manage their availabilities and thus meet their requirements.
The customer, on the other hand, books his or her project relaxed by using a smartphone. This avoids queues in front of and in shops.
"Platzhalter.io" combines simple usability with data economy, which in turn allows business and coexistence despite Covid19.
If "Platzhalter.io" is a relief, the user can donate. 

## How to use it ##
Businesses and non-profits can assign fixed slots and appointments to their customers and thus easily avoid queues, waiting times and distance problems. There is no technical know-how, no installation necessary - this applies to both the businss and the customer.
